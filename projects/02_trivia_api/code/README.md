# Full Stack API Final Project


## Full Stack Trivia

This project involved building out the backend API and testing structure using a TDD format.
The app is a simple trivia app which does the following:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

Further information on how to run the back and front ends can be found in their respective folders.

The frontend was completed by Udacity.
