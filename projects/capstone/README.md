# Full Stack Web Developer Capstone - Casting Agency

## Project Description

This project sets up the backend structure for a Casting Agency. The agency is responsible for creating movies and mananing and assigning actors to those movies. The backend sets up the required data models and web server API to store and serve data.

### About the Stack

The project only includes a backend. No frontend is currently configured.

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask server which uses the SQLAlchemy module. The folder contains scripts with the completed API endpoints, authentication and testing.
